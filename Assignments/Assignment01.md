1. Advantages and Disadvantages of Go.
- Advantages
    - Compiled language which makes the execution more faster.
    - It has automatic garbage collector, which prevents the wastage of memory
    - Concurrency is an ability of the go lang, to do multiple tasks at the same time.
    - Modern buildin libraries helps to make the code simple and safe.
- Disadavantages
    - Go has no GUI library which means a lot of time and knowledge youâ€™ll need to connect a library to your app instead of using native solutions like with Python or Java.
    - No generics in go
    - No functional support like cant have Mapreducer and streams.

2. Difference between Java and Go
- Java and Go both are compiled languages, but java requires the JVM(java virtual machine) to execute its bytecode but go doesnot need any virtual machine to execute.
- ease of coding is more in go when with java, because go has the lexer which automatically formats the syntax
- Go executes more faster then java because it doesnt need any virtual machine
- Go's garbage collection method is slightly more refined and well designed then Java

3. Difference between Python and Go
- Python is Interpreted language whereas Go is the Compiled language.
- Python follows the parallelism, where divide the task into multiple tasks in multiple processors using threads.Go follows the Concurrency which divide the task into multiple and executes at the same time by using the Goroutines.
- Memory management is more in Go when compared with the Python.

4. Difference between Signed and Unsigned Integers
- In Signed integers, the first right most bit represents the sign of that integer either positive or negative, if it is 1 then it is negative integer and 0 means it is positive integer.
- In Unsigned integers, all bits represent the magnitude of that integer, it does not have negative values.
